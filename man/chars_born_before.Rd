\title{Filter Characters Born Before a BBY Threshold}
\usage{
chars_born_before(year_threshold_bby)
}
\arguments{
\item{year_threshold_bby}{A positive numeric value representing the minimum BBY
year. Characters with a birth year greater than this value will be included.
(e.g., entering 50 finds those born before 50 BBY).}
}
\value{
A tibble (data frame) containing all columns of the filtered 'starwars'
dataset, arranged in descending order by 'birth_year' (oldest first).
}
\description{
Returns a subset of Star Wars characters who were born earlier
than (or "before") a specified year threshold (BBY).
}
\details{
This function is designed for chronological analysis. In the 'starwars'
dataset, the 'birth_year' is given in BBY (Before Battle of Yavin). Therefore,
a higher number indicates the character was born \emph{earlier} in the timeline.
The function filters for characters where 'birth_year' is \emph{greater} than
'year_threshold_bby', effectively finding the older individuals.
The input range is validated to be between 8 and 896.
}
\examples{
# Find characters born before 80 BBY (e.g., Yoda, Palpatine)
chars_born_before(year_threshold_bby = 80)

# Find characters born before 40 BBY
chars_born_before(year_threshold_bby = 40)

}
