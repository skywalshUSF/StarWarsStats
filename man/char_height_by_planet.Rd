\title{Filter Characters Taller Than a Minimum Height by Planet}
\usage{
char_height_by_planet(min_height)
}
\arguments{
\item{min_height}{A positive numeric value representing the minimum height
(in centimeters) for characters to be included in the output.}
}
\value{
A grouped tibble (data frame) with columns 'name', 'height', and
'homeworld', arranged by homeworld and descending height.
}
\description{
Subsets the Star Wars characters who meet or exceed a specified minimum height
and groups the results by their homeworld. Includes input validation.
}
\details{
This function is useful for identifying the tallest individuals and analyzing
their distribution across different planets. The resulting data frame includes
all 14 columns from the original \code{starwars} dataset, but is grouped by
\code{homeworld} and then sorted by height in descending order within each group.
}
\examples{

# Find all characters who are 200 cm (6'7") or taller
char_height_by_planet(min_height = 200)

# Find the giants of the galaxy (e.g., taller than 225 cm)
char_height_by_planet(min_height = 225)

}
