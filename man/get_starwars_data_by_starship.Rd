\title{Retrieve Characters Associated with a Specific Starship}
\usage{
get_starwars_data_by_starship(starship_name)
}
\arguments{
\item{starship_name}{A character string representing the name of the starship
to search for. The search is case-insensitive.}
}
\value{
A tibble (data frame) containing all 14 columns, showing all characters
who have the specified starship listed in their 'starships' column.
}
\description{
Filters the 'starwars' dataset to find characters who have
piloted a specific starship.
}
\details{
This function is designed to search within the 'starships' list-column
of the 'starwars' dataset. It performs a case-insensitive search, meaning
"Millennium Falcon" and "millennium falcon" will yield the same results.
If no matching starship is found, or if no characters are associated with it,
the function stops with a clear error message.
}
\examples{
# Find characters who have flown the Millennium Falcon
get_starwars_data_by_starship(starship_name = "Millennium Falcon")

# Find characters associated with the X-wing (case-insensitive)
get_starwars_data_by_starship(starship_name = "x-wing")

# Example of a non-matching ship (will stop execution)
# \dontrun{
# get_starwars_data_by_starship("Imperial Star Destroyer")
# }
