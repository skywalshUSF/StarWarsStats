\description{
Subsets the Star Wars characters based on a user-specified sex input ('M' or 'F').
}
\details{
This function validates the input, converts 'M' to "male" and 'F' to "female"
to match the values in the 'starwars' dataset, and then filters the data.
The function returns a focused table including the character's name, sex, and homeworld,
grouped by sex and sorted alphabetically by name.
}
