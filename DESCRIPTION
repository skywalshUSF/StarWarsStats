Description: The goal of this R Package is to provide a set of utility functions to easily load, filter, validate, and analyze data from the 'dplyr::starwars' data set, focusing on character attributes, names, heights, genders, and associated starships. The package offers robust, well documented examples of R programming techniques, including, 'dplyr' wrangling, input validation, and error handling within a fun, accessible domain. It was created as an educational exercise to demonstrate practical R function writing and documentation standards, and is primarily intended for students learning R programming who want hands on examples of data manipulation and building reuseable functions within validation checks.
